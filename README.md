# SteamAutoBoosterPack
No need to create and unpack steam booster pack manually everyday.

For using this script, `steam` package must be installed for python3.

[![steam 0.9.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/steam-0.9.1-blue.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/steam/)

`pip install steam`

`unpack_url` must be changed for diffent steam account, for my inventory path, it is `Chihang0711`.
`game_id` is a list containing all the games which you want to make booster pack.
